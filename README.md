# python-fileholder
File-sharing site written in python.

To try you can use 
> git clone https://github.com/yaripey/python-fileholder

Then run 

> pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need **FLASK_APP** variable set to "fileholder.py"

Then you need to run these commands to set up a database:

> flask db upgrade

Now you can just run *flask run* and everything should work just fine.
